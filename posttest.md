b) It displays the signal  
c) It stores the data  
d) It converts ionic currents into electrical signals  

### Q2. Which biomedical signal is associated with muscles?

a) EEG  
b) ERG

b) Surface electrodes (scalp electrodes)  
c) Microelectrodes  
d) Clip electrodes  

### Q4. Why do we need a biomedical system when electrodes already pick up the signals?
